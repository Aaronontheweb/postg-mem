# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the PostgMem project. ADRs are used to document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Each ADR describes:

- The architectural decision that was made
- The context and forces at play
- The current status (proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded)
- The consequences of the decision
